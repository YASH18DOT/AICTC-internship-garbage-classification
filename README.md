# AICTC-internship-garbage-classification
This project uses machine learning and image recognition to classify garbage into categories such as paper, cardboard, metal, trash, plastic, and glass. Accurate classification improves recycling efficiency, reduces landfill waste, and promotes a cleaner, more sustainable environment through smarter waste management.
